# Backend rules

- Follow clean architecture: controllers → services → models
- No frontend code in this folder
- No Expo / React Native assumptions
- Prefer readable, simple code
- Avoid over-engineering
- Keep files small and modular
- Use CommonJS (require/module.exports) unless stated otherwise
